Hello All,

I am a beginner coder who got into it because I have no personality and stole my boyfriend's hobby, 
I then sticked to it as started to enjoy it and realised it could also increase my career prospects. 
My goal is to apply my newly-acquired coding skills into the fields of Energy and Urban Planning.
