Hello All,

I am a beginner coder who got into it because I have no personality and stole my boyfriend's hobby, 
I then sticked to it as I realised learning how to code could increase my career prospects. 
My goal is to apply my newly-acquired coding skills into the field of Energy and Urban Planning.
